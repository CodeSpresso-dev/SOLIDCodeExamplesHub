# SOLID
Here are some code samples demonstrating how to apply SOLID principles in software development. These examples illustrate best practices for writing maintainable, scalable, and flexible code.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Example: Payment Processing
I demonstrate the application of SRP by implementing payment processing in a way that follows this principle.
Consider a scenario where we need to provide a way to make a payment with doing some validation and sending a confirmation message to the user.
Instead of having a single class that handles all payment processing, we can create separate classes for each action, each with a single responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

### Example: Mathematical Operations
I demonstrate the application of OCP by implementing mathematical operations in a way that follows this principle.
Consider a scenario where we need to perform different mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Instead of modifying the original class every time we want to add a new operation, we can extend the class by adding new operations without touching the existing functionality.
